### Welcome! 👋

I’m [@jcallaghan](https://jcallaghan.dev), an AI-focused Architect and Developer by day and an IoT supernerd by night. 🚀

As an Architect at [@Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft), I specialize in AI, Copilot, and OpenAI solutions, focusing on building scalable, full-stack applications that leverage React, Azure, OpenAI, serverless architectures, and Python. I’m passionate about UX design, using tools like Figma to prototype and craft intuitive user experiences. I thrive on innovation and ideation, transforming complex challenges into impactful, real-world solutions that make a difference.

Outside of work, I’m an IoT and Home Automation geek, constantly experimenting with [@Home-Assistant ](https://github.com/home-assistant)to make my home smarter and more efficient. Cooking is another passion of mine - I’m a big foodie and an amateur chef who loves trying new recipes and perfecting old favorites. When I’m not in the kitchen or tinkering with tech, you’ll find me riding my eMTB 🚵‍♂️ or capturing life’s beautiful moments through my lens 📸.
